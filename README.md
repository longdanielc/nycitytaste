I recently created an Instagram account so I would have a place to offload the oddball photos that were clogging up my phone. Not everyone I know has an Instagram account so, in order to share the photos with friends, I decided to create a website that mirrored my Instagram account. Not wanting to create ongoing work for myself, I built the website using Django, a Python web framework, to automatically pull and display photos from my Instagram account by accessing the Instagram API. After that, all that was needed to finish off the project was some CSS, JQuery and Google Fonts. I invite you to visit NYCityTaste.com and follow me on Instagram/@NYCityTaste or Twitter/@NYCityTaste. The project code is publicly available at GitHub.com/longdanielc.
